## Tournament Format

A double-elimination bracket is a tournament format where each team must lose two rounds before being eliminated from the competition. It provides a second chance for teams or individuals who lose in the early rounds.

Here's a basic explanation of how a double-elimination bracket works:

1. **Initial Matches:**
   - The tournament begins with all participants or teams placed in the first round of the winners' bracket.
   - Winners of these matches move forward in the winners' bracket, while the losers drop down to the losers' bracket.

2. **Winners' Bracket:**
   - Participants who continue winning in the winners' bracket progress further towards the final rounds.
   - As long as a team or individual keeps winning in the winners' bracket, they stay in that bracket.

3. **Losers' Bracket:**
   - Teams or individuals who lose in the winners' bracket drop down to the losers' bracket.
   - In the losers' bracket, participants have a chance to continue in the tournament. However, a second loss in the losers' bracket results in elimination.

4. **Rejoining the Winners' Bracket:**
   - The winners of matches in the losers' bracket may eventually make their way back to the winners' bracket if they keep winning.

5. **Finals:**
   - The final match is typically between the last remaining undefeated participant from the winners' bracket and the winner of the losers' bracket.
   - If the undefeated participant wins, they are the overall winner. If the winner of the losers' bracket wins, a final "championship" match may occur to determine the ultimate winner.

The double-elimination format is favored because it offers a fairer chance for participants. A single loss doesn't immediately eliminate a team or individual, giving them an opportunity to recover and potentially win the entire tournament. It also helps ensure that the overall winner has demonstrated consistent performance throughout the competition.

## Tournament Requirements

### Game Reset Review Process

- While reseting for games will be allowed, if the reset is contested by another team an automatic review will be done by the Tourney Organizers and Arbitrator
